<h1>Training an Artificial Neural Network with this dataset and Predicting the Diabetes</h1>
<br>
<h3>About Dataset:</h3>
<br>
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

<h3>Dataset: The dataset contains the following Columns (for clarity see the 'data.tsv'):</h3>
<br>
1) Preg = Number of times pregnant.<br>
2) GLU = Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test<br>
3) BP = Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<br>
4) ST = Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)<br>
5) INS = 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)<br>
6) BMI = Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)<br>
7) DPF = Diabetes pedigree function<br>
8) Age = Age in years<br>
<br>
9) Outcome  = 1 - YES (meaning the patient might Diabetes); 0 - NO (the patient doesn't Diabetes)
